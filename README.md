# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression** model to predict the **selling price of used cars**.  
The model uses real-world car attributes to estimate accurate used-car prices, helpful for buyers and sellers both.

## 🛠️ Features Used for Prediction
- **Year** – Manufacturing year  
- **Present_Price** – Ex-showroom price (when new)  
- **Kms_Driven** – Kilometers driven  
- **Fuel_Type** – Petrol / Diesel / CNG  
- **Seller_Type** – Dealer / Individual  
- **Transmission** – Manual / Automatic  
- **Owner** – Previous owners count
